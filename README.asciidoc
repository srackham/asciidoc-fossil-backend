= Fossil Backend for AsciiDoc


An http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] plugin for generating
http://www.fossil-scm.org[Fossil] friendly Wiki markup from AsciiDoc
source.


== Installation
To install the Fossil plugin download
https://github.com/downloads/srackham/asciidoc-fossil-backend/fossil.zip[fossil.zip]
and install it using the AsciiDoc (you will need AsciiDoc version
8.6.6 or newer):

  asciidoc --backend install fossil.zip


== Usage
Use the 'fossil' backend as you would the built-in backends then pipe
the output into Fossil. For example, this command will create a Wiki
page called 'AsciiDoc' in the current Fossil repository:

  asciidoc -b fossil -a iconsdir=./icons -o - asciidoc.txt | fossil wiki create AsciiDoc

This command updates the existing wiki page:

  asciidoc -b fossil -a iconsdir=./icons -o - asciidoc.txt | fossil wiki commit AsciiDoc

[NOTE]
--
- By default linked images and admonition icons will be embedded in
  the wiki documents using the
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme[data URI scheme]
  (AsciiDoc 'data-uri' and 'icons' attributes are set in the
  plugin's `fossil.conf` file).
- Older browsers (notably IE8) limit the size of data URIs.
- You will need AsciiDoc version 8.6.6 or newer to use the Fossil
  backend.
- To update an existing wiki page use the Fossil `wiki commit` command
  (not `wiki create`).
- Specifying the location of the admonition icons by setting the
  'iconsdir' attribute has been rendered unnecessary by

== Wiki HTML limitations
By default the Fossil http://fossil-scm.org/xfer/wiki_rules[wiki
formatting rules] enforce an HTML subset. If you want richer HTML
wiki pages you could enable the Fossil 'Use HTML as wiki markup language'
configuration option, but this is not advisable because:

. Malicious users could inject dangerous HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
  into your wiki.
. It is not a supported option.
. Wiki links `[...]` are translated to HTML links which in turn
  precludes the use of HTML embedded 'script' and 'style' elements.

Keep in mind that wikis are designed  to allow casual users to enter
short relatively simple notes. Project documentation (which is
often longer and more complex) is usually better served using
Fossil's
http://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/tip/www/embeddeddoc.wiki[Embedded
Documentation] feature.

Another gotcha is that currently the Fossil web server does not follow
symlinks, instead it displays the content of the symlink file.
