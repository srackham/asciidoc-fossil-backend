= Fossil Backend for AsciiDoc


An http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] configuration file
that can be used to create a simple backend plugin for generating
http://www.fossil-scm.org[Fossil] friendly Wiki markup from AsciiDoc
source (I wrote it as a proof-of-concept of the new AsciiDoc backend
plugins).


== Installation
To install the Fossil backend plubin download the `fossil.zip` file
and run:

  asciidoc --backend install fossil.zip


== Usage
Use the 'fossil' backend as you would the built-in backends. For
example, this command will insert a Wiki page called 'AsciiDoc' into
the current Fossil repository:

  asciidoc -b fossil -o - asciidoc.txt | fossil wiki commit AsciiDoc

NOTE: You will need AsciiDoc version 8.6.6 or better.
